# NN-assisted conditional moment calculation for KSE

A neural net approximates the moment of the conditional distribution. One neural net approximates the first moment and a second neural net approximate the second moment.

## Running the code

`bash runNN.sh`: Prepare the data and runs the conditional moment estimation from scratch. The training dataset is not available here since it would take too much space. Training dataset available upon request.

`bash runNN_pretrained.sh:` Prepare the data and plots the conditional moments using a pretrained model.
