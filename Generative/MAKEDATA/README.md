# Making the dataset

## Running the code

`python main.py inputKS`: Make the dataset used for conditional moment estimation. The code requires the full dataset which is not available. Dataset available upon request.

`python mainIntegralTime.py inputKS`: Compute the integral timescale of the KSE. Allows sampling multiple snapshots from a single realization.
